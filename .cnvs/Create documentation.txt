Update the following README.md file. Add description of the application: 2 paragraphs, 4-10 sentences. The application is a validation project written with Net6 Web API + unit tests (xUnit). It performs calls to a public API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) and collects data in a JSON format. Also, it accepts filtering and sorting rules and pagination functionality that allows users to consume only necessary data in selected amounts. The project aims to measure development process on each increment.

add section with at least 10 examples of how to use the developed endpoint. Here's the controller:
[ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class CountriesController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ICountriesService _countriesService;

        public CountriesController(ICountriesService countriesService)
        {
            _countriesService = countriesService;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<ActionResult<IReadOnlyCollection<Country>>> Get([FromQuery] FilterType filterType = 0, [FromQuery] string? query = null, string? sort = null, int limit = 15)
        {
            var filter = FilterFactory.Create(filterType, query);
            var countries = await _countriesService.FetchCountriesAsync(filter, sort, limit);

            return Ok(countries);
        }

regenerate p.6-10, since such functionality is not implemented. Here's available filter types:
public enum FilterType
{
    0, //None,
    1. //CountryCommonName,
    2 //CountryPopulation,
}
Also, filtering by population works as 'less than' only
